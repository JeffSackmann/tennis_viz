# Tennis Visualizations

This repo will contain code to generate various visualizations of tennis data, as well as the output itself and--occasionally--underlying data that doesn't exist elsewhere.

In general, the underlying data will come from my other repos (tennis_atp, tennis_wta, tennis_slam_pointbypoint, etc), and since I'm not that good at data viz, the primary value of the code in this repo is probably the data manipulation.

If I end up adding much stuff here, I'll make more of an effort to organize it. For the time being, code will live in the main directory of this repo, output will head to an output/ subdirectory, and any additional data I use that doesn't already live in one of my other repos will be stored in a data/ subdirectory.
